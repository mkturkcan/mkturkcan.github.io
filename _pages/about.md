Greetings! I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist in <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Columbia University</a>, focusing on deep learning applications. Previously, as a member of the <a href="http://www.bionet.ee.columbia.edu/">Bionet</a> group, I studied the efficient initialization and execution of very-large-scale, real connectome and synaptome driven, single-synapse-level simulations of neural circuits on GPUs for the purpose of understanding realistic neural networks. Afterwards, I worked on the design of computational circuits for understanding the mushroom body and the lateral horn, two brain regions in insects linked with associative and evolutionary memories. I am also one of the main developers of an open-source interactive neuroscientific computing platform called <a href="https://github.com/FlyBrainLab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlyBrainLab</a> (FBL) that enables access to, manipulation of and simulations for fruit fly brain data.</p>
