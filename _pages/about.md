Greetings! I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist in <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Columbia University</a> specializing in deep learning applications. My research focuses on real-world, low-latency deployment of object detection and trajectory prediction models, and retrieval-augmented generation via large language models. To test algorithms, I lead projects on large-scale data collection and annotation, and improve upon the state-of-the-art models to adapt them to the strict performance requirements of real-world use cases. Right now, my focus is specifically on applications to urban streetscapes and robotic surgeries.


Previously, as a member of the <a href="http://www.bionet.ee.columbia.edu/">Bionet</a> group, I studied the efficient initialization and execution of very-large-scale, real connectome and synaptome driven, single-synapse-level simulations of neural circuits on GPUs for the purpose of understanding realistic neural networks. Using the tools I developed, I worked on the design of computational circuits for understanding the mushroom body and the lateral horn, two brain regions in insects linked with associative and evolutionary memories. I am also one of the main developers of an open-source interactive neuroscientific computing platform called <a href="https://github.com/FlyBrainLab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlyBrainLab</a> (FBL) that enables access to, manipulation of and simulations for fruit fly brain data.
